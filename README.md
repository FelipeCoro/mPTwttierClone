# mParticle Android Takehome Test

This is the skeleton of an Twitter-clone Android app, designed to get you started. 


## Takehome Requirements

Please spend no longer than 4 hours on your solution. Generally speaking - don't worry about how pretty the UI is - focus on creating clean code and abstractions.

Please update the app with all of the following, or anything else that you think could be appropriate. Reference the official twitter app for ideas!

- Pulling a timeline of tweets from a service abstraction. The backing of this service could be a local database, a basic webservice, or a combination for offline scenarios.
- Add the ability to author a tweet
- Add the ability to add or remove followers
- Anything else you can think of - we want to see where you take it!

## Submission

- Please submit your solution via Hackerrank or privately share a git repo. 
- Include a write-up of how you would scope out the future of this project (what could come next, improvements you'd make, etc)
